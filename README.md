**Instalation**
<br>
It is quite literally the same way like usual. Just put all the files on a folder inside the Themes folder of your OITG instalation.

**Purpose of Porting**
<br>
The actual idea of porting this theme, was initially because i wanted a challenge. I usually just port Sm3.9 themes with the help of my <a href="https://github.com/JoseVarelaP/OITGThemerFallback">OITGThemerFallback</a>, but never a SM4.0 theme. Then I went bored and decided to port a Sm4 theme, and this one particular theme series came to my mind first.
